Future development:
Strong password generator that uses mouse to generate a base for an RNG seed, after that it calculates values out of the base and generates
the seed.  (calculations coming in later)

Current Master:
Uses plain 1000-4000 len string as seed, mapped by users mouse input

Maybe:
Photo/facial recognition seed generation with facial structure
